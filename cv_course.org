* Image Processing
    - What is image?
      Image is an 2d array of pixels and pixels is just an integer(if black and white pic) or an array of integers(if color pic).

    - Image File
      The image file is divided into three parts:-
      1. Header : Contains meta data of the image file like height, width, compression format(ex: png,bmp,..)
      2. Streams of pixels that makes the image
      3. EOF: End Of File

** A few concepts and operations
*** Image Histogram
    + An image histogram is a type of histogram that acts as a graphical representation of the tonal distribution in a digital image.

    + Now we will take given image below and make a histogram for the distribution of pixel values. We will be using python with opencv and matplotlib.
#+caption: a picture of a page
#+name: page
[[./images/page.jpg]]

#+begin_src python
#importing necessary libraries
import cv2 as cv
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')
from matplotlib import pyplot as pt

#read image
img = cv.imread('images/page.jpg',0)

# find frequency of pixels in range 0-255
histr = cv.calcHist([img],[0],None,[256],[0,256])

#plot the graph
pt.plot(histr)

#Save it as an image
pt.savefig('images/page_hist.png')
#instead of saving as an image you can directly see the picture after the execution of the program using pt.show()
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: None


#+caption: this is the histogram of the image
[[./images/page_hist.png]]
